# 0x01. Python - Async

## Resources
<b>Read or watch:</b>

* [Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)
* [asyncio - Asynchronous I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
* [random.uniform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* `async` and `await` syntax
* How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
* How to run concurrent coroutines
* How to create `asyncio` tasks
* How to use the `random` module

## Requirements
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
